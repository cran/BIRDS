\title{A function to explore the definition of field visits}
\usage{
exploreVisits(x, visitCol = NULL, sppCol = "scientificName")
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{an object of class \sQuote{OrganizedBirds} (organised BIRDS Spatial Dataframe).
See \code{\link{organizeBirds}}.}

\item{visitCol}{name of the column for the visits UID.}

\item{sppCol}{name of the column for species names.}
}
\value{
a \code{data.frame} with summarized data per visit:
\itemize{
  \item \dQuote{day}
  \item \dQuote{month}
  \item \dQuote{year}
  \item \dQuote{nObs}: number of species observations
  \item \dQuote{SLL}: species list length (i.e. the number of observed species)
  \item \dQuote{effortDiam}: the 2 times the maximum of the distances between
  the centroid of all observation points and any individual observation.
  \item \dQuote{medianDist}: the median (Q2) of the distances between the
  centroid and the observations, in meters.
  \item \dQuote{iqrDist}: the interquartile range of the distances between the
   centroid the observations, in meters.
  \item \dQuote{nOutliers}: the number of observations whose distance to the
  centroid are considered an outlier. Ouliers are defined as distances grater
  than the Q3 * 1.5 (i.e. \code{length(boxplot.stats(distances)$out)} as all
  distances are positive).

\description{
A function to explore the definition of field visits. Visits are a central concept
in the approach to species observation data used by the BIRDS package. In order to assess if your
definition of visit aligns with your grid size, you must explore the spatial extent of visits.

\examples{
if(interactive()){
# create a visit-based data object from the original observation-based data
OB<-organizeBirds(bombusObs)
visitStats<-exploreVisits(OB)
 esquisse::esquisser(visitStats)
# alternatively, plot the variable you want, e.g.:
# to see the distribution of distances covered on each visit
hist(visitStats$effortDiam)
# to see the distribution of species list lengths of each visit
hist(visitStats$SLL)
# to identify suspicious visits reported the first day of each month or year
hist(visitStats$day)
# to see correlations
plot(visitStats$nObs, visitStats$effortDiam)
plot(visitStats$SLL, visitStats$effortDiam)
# to see the ditributions of observations along the days of the month
plot(visitStats$day, visitStats$nObs)
